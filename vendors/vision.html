                    <p>We understand that when you need our products you want them as soon as possible. VISION has built high stock levels with more than 1,000 items currently available and we have taken proactive steps to counteract Brexit’s negative effect on UK imports.</p>
                    <p>Our LIFR (Line Item Fulfilment Rate) is usually 95% and even with the negative impact of Brexit, we have been able to achieve 88% in February and are building back to normal levels every month.</p>
                   <p>We hold stock across warehouses in the UK and EU and move it in response to demand. Using a Microsoft Azure-based algorithm enables us to predict where stock will be needed and move it pre-emptively. Should more stock be required than is showing on the system give us a call because we usually have plenty of stock to call on from other warehouses.</p>

                <p>Can hybrid meetings engage all participants? Find out how from Dana Corey, SVP and GM at Avocor whose ALZ range is making waves in the way it brings Zoom into the meeting room.</p>

                <p>We’ve all gotten used to doing quick calls and hopping on video for a chat. However what about the big meetings, when you need your team to be engaged? How can you make sure everyone is involved and you avoid the dreaded “could this not have been said in an email?”</p>
                 
                <p>Without the nonverbal communication gained from sharing the same space it can be tricky for team leaders to perceive energy levels in the meeting. But with hardware, and some best practice, it is entirely possible to maximise the value of your meetings.</p>
                 
                <p>First, let’s go over the basics. Over the last few years, digital transformation has created a standard of technology. Your meeting room should have: an interactive display, a high-quality webcam with microphones alongside and most importantly the correct software and platform.</p>
                 
                <p>What makes a platform correct depends on a range of variables such as what kind of ecosystem a team primarily works in, e.g. Gsuite, Teams or Adobe etc.</p>

                <h2>First impressions are everything </h2>
                <p>So you’ve got your interactive display, your camera and microphone. Everyone can hear you loud and clear. One thing you can’t plan for, however, is other participants’ hardware solutions or technical capabilities.</p>

                <p>It has become an unwritten rule that meetings should start either on the hour or at half past, and most participants join calls bang on the start time. This then often leads to dead meeting time while latecomers connect, Katy fiddles with her webcam and Toby figures out how to enable his microphone. Anticipate this delay, and plan your presentation to last 50 minutes rather than the full hour. If everyone connects quickly great, you can get started sooner and finish succinctly.</p>
                
                <p>While everybody is joining, give your participants a short shared activity that everyone can take part in. This could be something like all enjoying a cup of tea/coffee together, writing down a single word that sums up their day so far, or sharing something funny they have seen while procrastinating (just make sure it’s safe for work!). If participants don’t know each other make sure introductions happen. While you’re obviously not at work just to socialise, an element of camaraderie does wonders for a positive workplace culture.</p>
                
                <p>That being said, once you’ve gotten started stick to the meeting. Don’t spend time talking about unrelated topics. If there is a topic that fits in with what you are saying, but needs some extra time, it’s a good idea to allocate a separate section of the meeting to it – and if it is another topic entirely then it is best to schedule a separate meeting.</p>

                <h2>Create engagement</h2>
                <p>Most people know that meetings are better when everyone is fully involved and engaged. A study by HBR says that 86% of meeting attendees say that engagement in virtual meetings is as high as traditional, in-office meetings – or even higher. This is largely due to the amazing potential for interactivity in virtual meetings.</p>
 
                <p>It is widely known that interactivity has enormous benefits for businesses; marketers report that interactive content generates twice as many conversions as passive content, as well as a whole host of other impressive statistics. It is also reported by Outgrow that the most read article in the New York Times in 2013 was a quiz, and that 96% of people who start Buzzfeed quizzes finish them.</p>
                 
                <p>An interactive display is a great interactive whiteboard alternative – having one of these wherever the chairman of the meeting is (whether that be in office or at home) is a great idea to keep the meeting fun and engaging.</p>

                <h2>In closing</h2>
                <p>As your meeting comes to a close if your platform supports it, use a polling tool for a final question. Teams, Zoom and Google can all save meeting transcripts and record the meetings themselves, so send those out to your participants (just in case they were so enthralled they forgot to take notes).”</p>

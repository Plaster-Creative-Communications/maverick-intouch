                <p>Google Meet is one of the most convenient platforms available for video collaboration. Simon Kitson looks at what it offers and the latest hardware that supports its use.</p>

                <p>Cutting straight to the chase; blended, hybrid and remote are words that have taken over the channel and Google has the software and hardware to provide great solutions.</p>
                
                <p>Let’s begin with the platform, and ask the question Why choose Google? It’s popular: in 2019 more than five million paying businesses were using G Suite, and thanks to many of the basic tools being included with a personal Gmail account there are over two billion monthly active users around the world who are familiar with the software. Moreover, the Chrome browser is far and away the most popular with a 65.9% market share in July 2020 and Google’s Android operating system is pervasive in mobile sales with a 74.45% share of global users. The reason this is important is that it can provide users access to the infinite possibilities afforded within the same platform they also use for video meetings.</p>
                
                <p>Once you’re on the platform, how is the experience? It has everything we have come to expect from a VC platform; share screen, HD resolution, instant messaging, layout change and most importantly it does them all well. However, what makes it unique is something that is often forgotten about – this is closed captions. Thanks to user data from products such as YouTube and Google assistant the platform has some of the most robust closed captions making it one of the most accessible platforms.</p>
                
                <p>To take full advantage of these opportunities, Google and Asus have teamed up to develop more specialised hardware to help companies with easy-to-use video conferencing tools. The duo have launched three new Google Meet hardware kits, one for every size of meeting room. These kits are ideal for businesses that have found themselves in need of regular video conferences in small, socially-distanced rooms or from remote locations.
                The power of Google Meet hardware has been improved with a new ASUS Google Meet computer system, as a replacement for the Chromebox. The new slim design, rear I/O ports and magnetic wall mount stand allow for more practical deployment and cable management. The microphone is now compatible with Google Assistant, and the sound is captured and reproduced by an ASUS Google Meet speaker-mic base that is capable of 360° capture to a range of 6m.</p>
                
                <p>The heart of these kits is a new Google Meet Compute System, which is also actually a new name for what ASUS used to call a Chromebox. The new Google Meet Compute system (GQE10A) is redesigned for Meet. The new Intel i7 processor enhances performance along with an upgraded with 128GB SSD.</p>
                
                <p>Finally, the Camera. The kit comes with a Huddly IQ which has a 150° wide-angle view with a wide-angle distortion correction to cover everybody in the meeting room (sized up to 23 square metres). The Huddly IQ camera has glass optics, a 4K image sensor and improved noise reduction that maintains image details.</p>

                <p>It’s your house, your rules. So naturally, on these matters the user knows best. But when it comes to cold hard tech, there are some great new innovations to check out as we sink our teeth firmly into 2021. </p>

                <h2>Know your kit</h2>
                <p>Investing in good quality VC kit is one thing, but you need to know its functions and more importantly its limitations. If you’re a little unsure then speaking to our teams will get you started on the right path.</p>

                <p>For instance, did you know that if you’re a Zoom user you can drastically improve your sound quality by selecting the “Enable Original Sound” function. Teams, Google Meet and Zoom also all have options to enable HD quality on your camera, so if you have the bandwidth, then make sure that box is ticked.</p>
                
                <p>The last thing to focus on is bringing in a wired network connection into your workspace. This will vastly improve your virtual working environment. It will improve your overall stability across all online work, and you’ll find you have clearer sound and vision.</p>

                <h2>Premier Audio Quality</h2>
                <p>Hand in hand with image quality is sound quality. The best camera in the world means next to nothing if your teams can’t understand a word you’re saying.</p>

                <p>Audio can be a little tricker to recommend off the shelf - there is a lot of dependency on the space you’re in and how that affects sound quality - you can still make some investments into quality kit that’ll make you heard.</p>

                <p>Two of the most common problems with audio are that background noise is drawing you out, or you just aren’t being heard enough. To fix the former and the latter, you might want to consider a headset such as the Logitech Zone.</p>

                <p>A wireless bluetooth headset designed with VC in mind, battery and talk time are incredible and the mic array picks up the clear sound of your voice. It also features flip-to-mute, so should you need to go on mute, that functionality is right there on the headset.</p>

                <p>If you’re not a headset kind of person another option would be something like the Logitech Brio. A marvellous piece of VC kit which combines the best of both quality image and sound, in one small yet powerful camera that is fully Teams, Zoom and Google certified.</p>

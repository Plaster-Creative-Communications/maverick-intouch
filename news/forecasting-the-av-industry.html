                <p>Julian Phillips of AVI-SPL and Sean Wargo of AVIXA discuss how hope lies in multi-year projects, accelerated investment in smart meetings, and upgrades to existing spaces.</p>

                <p>Although we can all agree that the shape of the industry isn’t the same as it was a few months ago, the jury is still out as to where we’re going. One thing is clear from economic forecasters which is that the pandemic will trigger some kind of global recession. Despite this, there is reason to be hopeful when it comes to the AV industry. </p>
                
                <p>Julian Phillips from AVI-SPL and Sean Wargo from AVIXA shed some light on the situation</p>
                
                <p>Speaking on  the state of current AV projects AVI-SPL is involved with, Julian said: “There are very few projects which have been cancelled. Most of what we’re seeing are delays,” </p>
                
                <p>Many projects that AVI-SPL is involved with aren’t one-offs but multi-phased, managed service projects.</p>
                
                <p>Furthermore, many customers now want to accelerate rather than slow down. “Most organisations are going to realise that they weren’t really prepared for the dramatic shift into the toolsets they are now very dependent on,” Julian told us. Some of AVI-SPL’s customers want to roll out infrastructure which supports cloud collaboration and smart meetings more quickly than planned, to better support the way their business is changing. In the long run, this could be very beneficial to the industry.</p>
                
                <p>Sean Wargo of AVIXA busts some of the myths surrounding the AV industry. “People think pro-AV is dependent on construction, but that’s not quite true,” he explained. During the last recession, the construction industry took a 30 per cent hit, whilst AV dipped by just a few percentage points. This shows that new builds are just one part of the AV industry, and many contracts involve upgrading existing spaces.
                He pointed out that the events industry is one of the worst affected, and that trade shows might look quite different in years to come. Sean echoes Julian in that there is a greater need for virtualisation, but trade shows are by no means over.</p>
                
                <p>The AV industry is changing, but it has a critical role in shaping the new normal though its support of remote working and collaboration. Projects will be delayed, some areas of the business will slow, but it’s important that the industry recognises its influence in shaping the future of businesses across virtually every sector.</p>

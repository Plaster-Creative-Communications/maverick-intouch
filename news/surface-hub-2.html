                <p>Lockdown has shown just how well it handles meetings in open and socially distanced spaces, with remote workers brought in via the Microsoft Teams platform whose usage is booming.</p>

                <p>With workplaces currently in the biggest state of flux ever experienced, technology that is adaptable and enabling the revolution that is underway is crucial to enabling businesses to transform.</p>
                 
                <p>As of 14 June, Teams had grown by 894% over a period of just three months. With constant updates since its launch in 2017, Microsoft has developed one of the most effective communication and collaboration platforms. Resellers are now navigating how to enable users to return to work with higher knowledge and expectations of their platforms and how they integrate with their meeting rooms and work environments. This is where the Microsoft Surface Hub 2S presents an enticing opportunity.</p>
                 
                <p>A modern collaboration tool that synthesises more than 30 years of Windows into a slick and easy experience is ideal for adaptation into hybrid work environments; enabling the user to bring remote workers into a meeting as seamlessly as on their personal device. From the start menu you can ‘one touch join’ a call and begin sharing content. The 4K camera makes sure you are seen in great quality. </p>
                 
                <p>The updates to Whiteboard which happened at the start of the year which enable simultaneous collaboration, with multiple users able to bring in assets directly from the web or even import presentations and work together on one canvas. This means a whiteboard in a space can be used by everyone in a new hybrid meeting.
                We’ve seen some very interesting uses of the Microsoft Surface Hub 2S since lockdown, which has really highlighted the power of flexibility in technology applications. </p>
                 
                <p>Quite early on we started demonstrating our fleet of displays from the homes of our collaboration experts.</p> 
                 
                <p>The Steelcase Roam mobile stand was developed alongside the Hub 2S, while the APC Charge Mobile Battery – which slides into the stand – was designed to power the Surface Hub 2S with true mobility.
                This is now coming into its own, enabling meetings in open and socially distanced spaces while remote workers are brought in via Teams. No more putting laptops on desks, meaning remote workers struggle to hear and see participants. Team members can be heard and seen with its powerful camera and microphone. In our meetings it picks up questions over seven metres away.</p>
                 
                <p>This is just one of the ecosystem of Teams-enabled collaboration solutions which are being tested to help businesses get back to the workplace. Sharp’s Windows Collaboration Display and the Microsoft Teams Rooms devices both enable users to seamlessly create the Teams meetings which have become their new normal during lockdown.</p>

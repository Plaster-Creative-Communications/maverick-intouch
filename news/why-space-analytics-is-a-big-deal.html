                <p>The aftershock of the Covid-19 crisis will call for a better understanding of workspaces. Space analytics is the answer… </p>

                <p>Although you may have heard the term, space analytics is still very much in its infancy. Its aim is big: to use data insight to completely revolutionise the way we think about spaces, but if we know anything about the AV industry, it’s that we like to think big.</p>
                 
                <p>The crux of space analytics is actually very simple. Design workspaces with a variety of spaces, fitted with sensors and interactive endpoints which collect data, and then use this data to inform decisions about spatial design and usage. This will allow managers to make best use of their buildings, optimising space, place, people and technology.</p>
                 
                <p>The reasoning behind space analytics is the same as that behind analytics in web design or digital signage. Collecting user data provides insight into behaviour at a huge scale, insight which can then be used to design future content. In space analytics, this concept is tracked over to the workplace and its peripheral technologies.</p>
                 
                <p>By fitting rooms with sensors which measure occupancy, time and usage, managers can collect insight to make decisions on anything from when to switch on the air conditioning, to what kind of technology to install, to how to design future workplaces.</p>
                 
                <p>This will become all the more important as the future of the workplace begins to take shape. The global economy has been forced into a crash course on remote working, ushering in a new way of operating, with a greater reliance on smart meetings, VC and connectivity. As teams adjust to being scattered apart, businesses will compete to flourish in separated circumstances which means a huge incentive to review the spaces they occupy once restrictions are lifted.</p>
                 
                <p>We can expect working remotely to play a more important role in the businesses of tomorrow, with workers working more flexibly between the office and elsewhere. This calls for a greater need to understand how spaces are being used, and how to equip spaces with the technology that supports these changes. Watch this space!</p>

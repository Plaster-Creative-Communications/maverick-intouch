                <p>With schools, colleges and universities closed for the summer, finding the right technology for blended learning and implementing hybrid learning models has become the number one priority. With that, new mounts and accessories have had to be rapidly developed, to enable more spaces with smart learning solutions.</p>

                <p>In a recent survey from the Department of Education, 41% of schools surveyed identified that BYOD is a key area to prioritise for implementation over the next two years.</p>
                
                <p>Minh Vothi of accessories and mount manufacturer Vision explains;</p>
                
                <p>“A modern classroom should be prepared for any student's requirements, especially higher education students who are using a wide range of hardware that might be centuries old! There needs to be seamless interaction between the student and the tech in the room and it should be accessible to the widest possible range of users.”</p>
                
                <p>The question is, what holds the perfect classroom together and what accessories can help to ensure accessibility and usage for both pupils and teachers?</p>
                
                <p>It’s clear that teachers would like to see tangible proof of EdTech’s effectiveness in the classroom. Connectivity and accessories are going to be the first way users approach this tech. Therefore its importance cannot be understated in creating the perfect classroom. Interactive displays have firmly re-established themselves as an effective education solution and next-gen. To create practically in the classroom these displays need to be accessible, easy to move and securely mounted.</p>
                
                <p>“More than ever, organisations need flexibility and want the display and speakers mounted on a portable trolley for use in any location within the workplace where collaboration is taking place. The rapid transition in education towards digital classrooms is why Vision continues to make improvements to our product functionality and performance, in addition to new product launches to expand product portfolio, and to optimize offerings.”</p>
                
                <p>Vision's flat-panel mount VFM-F40/W offers the smart learning solution of portable mounts for interactive and non-interactive displays. Seamlessly moving LFD’s from room-to-room with motor ability to ensure great viewing angles for every student and teacher. Vision's floor stands transmit the load of the heavy display safely to the floor. This stand is optimized for use in meeting spaces where a high quality fit and finish is essential.</p>
                
                <p>While its product innovation has a wider scope of applications, it is their practical and modular design of Techconnect Control 3 that gives their products a unique edge. It works on simplifying the system for users, with customisable options to fit the everyday functions of the user. Techconnect is a modular audio-visual faceplate family engineered especially for AV installers propelling the demand for ed-tech.</p>
                
                <p>The Techconnect control technology is the most flexible professional AV control device available. This simple control panel controls all of your AV equipment – projectors, flat panels, amplifiers, and screens – simultaneously and only presents users with the functions they use every day. This reduces the need for tech support calls creating an all secure module.</p>
                
                <p>As learning develops, so does the need for progressive and influential technology. Vision offers excellent AV installation accessories to meet such demands and continues to offer reliable and exceptionally easy products for learning accessibility. </p>
                
                <p>Vision’s products such as the VFM-F40 , are available for demonstration from the Maverick team. Contact info@tdmaverick.eu for virtual demos and samples for your projects.</p>

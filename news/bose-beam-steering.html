                <p>With the imminent return to the office, it is inevitable that multiple conversations — both in person and in meetings — will take place simultaneously in shared spaces. Although our offices may be more distanced than when we left, they will be just as noisey. We spoke with Bose expert, Russell Harpham, Business Development, about why their meeting room devices are top of everyone’s mind and featured in several articles on how Bose technology leads the way in the hybrid workplace.</p>

                <p>Videobars, like the Bose Videobar VB1 USB all-in-one conferencing device, will be the heart of small and medium meeting rooms, making rapid and high-quality video conferencing both affordable and intuitive for the end user. </p>

                <p>Collaboration is about more than just talking whilst being around a desk or conference table. Collaboration includes the freedom to move around the room, talk and present dynamically — all of which adds so much to the conversation for both the speaker and audience. This multi-layered approach to communicating is why Bose continues to work on bringing our sound expertise and commitment to video into the meeting room through the new Videobar VB1.</p>

                <p>Bose Work solutions create effective noise cancellation and excellent audio amplification, unsurprisingly, Bose brought their heritage and reputation in hi-fi and packed it into the VB1 along with impressive video technology.</p>

                <p>What gives the Bose VB1 it’s unique edge over outfitting a variety of different room configurations is its advanced beam-steering technology. Unlike beam forming, which statically aims at specific points of the room, it allows the user to determine where the microphones will aim, setting them to either automatically ‘hunt’ and search for the person talking or use a pre-determined setup that dictates exactly where the beams should be focused. This means the Bose VB1 can cover a variety of room shapes for superior audio pickup. </p>

                <p>For spaces that have less flexibility, the mics can be set or locked down, ensuring the exclusion zones are set up to minimise far end echo and background noise in areas surrounding the huddle space. It also equalises conversations between participants located in different parts of the room so everyone is heard at the same volume.</p>

                <p>While the Bose VB1 aims to solve the audio issues of video conferencing, poor visibility of what is being shared also has a massive impact on productive hybrid meetings. The Bose VB1 tackles these issues with its auto-framing 4K ultra-HD camera, which allows movement around the meeting space all while keeping the speaker in view. Other video presets include a far shot to capture all meeting participants, a near shot to zoom in on whiteboards or other written material, and panning left and right, as well as the basic image controls such as flicker.</p> 

                <p>The Bose VB1 is a product that makes a great meeting experience as accessible as possible. There are a host of different settings that play into this ability as well as the videobar being networkable. With Bluetooth readily available, mobile devices such as laptops, phones or tablets easily pair to the Bose VB1 and control is at your fingertips.</p>

                <p>The Bose VB1 is not cloud based and can be located throughout the organisations network and managed from wherever you are. And the single-cable connectivity means there’s no need for separate audio and video cables at the table, reducing clutter.</p>

                <p>Have I enticed you to learn more about Bose’s Videobar VB1 and its pioneering capabilities? Visit us and take a look and you’ll see what everyone has been talking about.</p>

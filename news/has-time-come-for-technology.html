                <p>Technology as a Service (TaaS) has been spoken about for over a decade in the AV industry without emerging as a trend. The post-pandemic return to work could change that, writes Joel Chimoindes.</p>

                <p>No longer the preserve of the boardroom, the explosion of video calling means AV products are everywhere in the office of the future. The pandemic showed us that creating recurring revenue streams is vital to move away from a reliance on hardware projects, helping us provide continual innovation to end users, more in keeping with IT infrastructure than ever before.</p>

                <p>Technology as a service saves money and generates revenue. For resellers, end users and manufacturers. It is a hardware and service payment model that keeps pace with the modern rate of innovation in AV and IT.</p>

                <p>To simplify greatly, it operates in the same way a £10 monthly Netflix subscription provides access to what would cost hundreds of pounds in physical DVDs.  Just as users can see the latest releases, customers using TaaS can ensure that their technology is always up to date by creating a subscription plan that ends after a few years. They can then update the plan to include the latest displays, camera, etc. The rate of innovation alongside the ability to integrate software as well as hardware, means this enables customers to respond quickly to new opportunities.</p>

                <p>We’re lucky to be part of one of the biggest IT businesses in the world, giving our customers access to one of the most advanced TaaS platforms in the world.
                Prior to TaaS if businesses wanted to finance their hardware it would involve rigid contracts that incurred higher cost via interest and after the cost had been eventually paid off customers would be left with tech nearing obsolescence. Now everything is contained in Tech Data’s InTouch website, which provides complete flexibility. Customers can create entirely bespoke packages for their clients, and have complete control over margins on products and services. This includes technology and services that aren’t supplied by Tech Data. You could include installation, services, management, and drop insurance. Just type in a custom entry then all of this is automatically fitted into a final PDF that includes all the fees.</p>

                <p>In older times this would then have to be sent off and looked over by a financier, and within two or so weeks you may or may not be approved. With TaaS, anything under £50,000 can be underwritten within ten minutes.</p>

                <p>The biggest incentive to resellers of Tech Data as a service are the savings generated by spreading the cost and returning the equipment, but around that central pitch the company has created a tool that saves time, money and one that stands out amongst other services with its seamless integration of third party services and technology.</p>

                <p>Joel Chimoindes is vice president of Maverick AV Solutions Europe, part of the Tech Data group. To discover more about Tech Data as a service visit www.servicesbytechdata.com/taas.</p>

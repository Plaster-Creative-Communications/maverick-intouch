                <p>BARCELONA, Spain, May 11, 2022 – Maverick AV Solutions, a specialist division of Tech Data, a TD SYNNEX Company, has announced a distribution agreement with world-leading audio and microphone manufacturer and communications specialist Sennheiser at Integrated Systems Europe 2022 today. </p>

                <p>The Sennheiser solutions now available through Maverick address the growing market demand for best-in-class audio experiences in the modern meeting space and will be available across the distributor’s whole European footprint. </p>

                <p>The selection of meeting room technologies includes the newly announced TeamConnect Intelligent Speaker (TC ISP) for Microsoft Teams Rooms and bestselling TeamConnect Ceiling 2 microphone (TCC2). The agreement introduces Sennheiser to the IT channel, extending the reach of their meeting room audio solutions. </p>

                <p>Simon Kitson, director, smart meetings, Europe, Maverick, said: “This is a great opportunity for us to further our Teams for Meetings portfolio and offer best-in-class solutions for large meeting rooms. By adding both the TC ISP and TCC2 to our Teams Rooms Solutions, we are able to provide more advanced audio and collaboration technology and pave the way for meeting equity within smart spaces.” </p>

                <p>The TeamConnect Ceiling 2 microphone array, which is specially designed for ceiling installation, can be elegantly integrated into every room environment and ensures that the participants’ contributions are transmitted with an outstanding level of detail regardless of their individual position in the room.</p>

                <p>Bart Stam, distribution manager EMEA for Sennheiser, said: “By adding Maverick AV solutions as a distribution partner to our existing sales channels, we are convinced that our business communication products will find their way better to IT resellers and integrators. This exciting collaboration will enable even more customers to experience Sennheiser's advanced audio technology products. The TC ISP and TCC2 products are intuitive, agnostic and audibly better while offering true problem-solving capabilities for lecture spaces and meeting rooms.”</p>

                <p>TeamConnect Ceiling 2 is ideally suited for medium-sized to large meeting rooms of around 14 to 16 participants, equivalent to an area of between 50 and 60 square metres. Several ceiling mics can be combined to achieve greater coverage, for example in very large rooms or ones with an unfavourable shape. It is the perfect solution for all conference and meeting rooms where excellent speech intelligibility, simple handling and seamless integration into the existing room environment are required.</p>

                <p>As a Microsoft Teams certified intelligent speaker, the TC ISP is specifically designed to activate your hybrid workspace and empower your team to connect wherever they are. With advanced voice recognition, the TC ISP differentiates between voices to automatically transcribe meetings; sending notifications of tasks and inviting participants to follow up meetings. Designed with an omnidirectional speaker with a 3.5m radius and 7 integrated beamforming microphones, it provides a real-life experience for all participants and supports the new hybrid working environment.</p>

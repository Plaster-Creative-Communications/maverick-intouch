            <p>Peter Ayres, Specialist business development manager, dives into the current LED workspace trends focusing on maximising use of digital signage.</p>

            <p>As people return to the office and we move to the hybrid workplace, most businesses are investing in digital signage to maximise employee engagement and alignment through smarter workspaces, both from a workplace experience and in some cases, adhering to safety requirements. </p>

            <p>Businesses now need to ensure they can elevate their communications strategy, manage physical spacing, logging visitors entering the workplace and safety check-in procedures in a lobby or entrance, as well as  creating a great sense of welcome. The answer is digital signage solutions. </p>

            <p>When integrated with room scheduling and big data, digital signage software takes the power of the touchscreen (or touchless displays) and positions it in areas of offices that are most useful such as meeting or conference rooms. Within lobby and reception areas, digital signage can be used in a variety of ways: from welcoming incoming visitors to the office, announcing company-wide meetings, providing information on event attendees and aiding in easy wayfinding with interactive maps.</p>

                <h2>Digital entry systems </h2>

                <p>Door entry systems are a reliable access solution that allows businesses to control footfall into their buildings by verifying authorised individuals and granting them access. These displays can also feature facial recognition with infrared thermal imaging checking temperature, a welcome precaution and effective solution for businesses using hot-desking, shared office spaces or managing safety post pandemic.</p>

                <h2>Feature wall displays</h2>

                <p>LED display technology isn’t a new phenomenon, but it has undergone a massive evolution. With the wide availability of lower-cost, higher-resolution screens, the once sought after video walls are now a thing of the past. Businesses are now looking to truly make a statement with high bright, huge scale lobby displays. By incorporating interactive and reactive signage technologies, businesses can now engage with employees and visitors in unique and innovative ways, with statement content and a wow factor as you enter the building.

                <h2>Real-time content and information</h2>

                <p>Good communication is essential. Digital screens can also be used for employee engagement, on as much a personal level as professional. One of the leading benefits of digital signage solutions is that updates become instant and therefore automatically visible for employees and visitors. Unlike manually updated check-in, teams can see live occupancy via IOT sensors updating to displays, meetings taking place that day, live press coverage for the business or important internal messaging as they move around the office.

                <h2>Digital Wayfinding</h2>

                <p>In terms of facility and employment management, digital signage wayfinding software can include helpful features like point-to-point navigation, pop-up directory information, and interactive maps that let a user dictate their wayfinding experience and get the information they need.

                <h2>Artificial intelligence and AI-driven personalisation</h2>

                <p>AI developments are now being used to enhance workplace technology, and among the benefits of using AI, is the ability to streamline the data collection process and deploy experiences driven by that data. One of the best applications of AI in the lobby is personalisation.</p>

                <p>With AI driven digital signage, employees will not only be able to see their names and details on screens, but eventually we will see displays that automatically configure themselves to meet individual user’s specific needs.</p>

                <p>The best type of interactions between business and employee are those that prioritise end-users and fully understand the value of delivering personalised experiences in the workplace. </p>

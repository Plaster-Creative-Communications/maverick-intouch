                <h2>We caught up with Head of Solutions & Services, Maverick UK, Jim Fitton about how Pre-Sales & Installation Services are designed to help resellers win more business and drive innovation into their clients’ meeting spaces.</h2>

                <p>Effective meeting rooms are essential spaces for businesses to communicate, collaborate and make decisions.</p>
                
                <p>However, even today many meeting rooms are ill-equipped to deal with a modern workforce requiring support for hybrid working and effective collaboration, so creating a meeting space that’s beneficial to productive working for both in-person and remote attendees is a key priority for most businesses.</p>
                
                <p>With more organisations embracing trends such as collaboration, mobile working and BYOD, it is becoming more important than ever before to ensure that meeting room technology enables a seamless experience for all participants while maintaining productivity and efficiency.</p>
                
                <p>Maverick AV solutions installation and deployment services can help. Our unique combination of hardware solutions, value-added services and support enables our partners to win more business, enhance profitability and drive innovation into their clients’ meeting spaces.</p>

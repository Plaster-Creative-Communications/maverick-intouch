                <p>As digital signage explodes in popularity, are we at the tipping point? Over the last few months CMS providers are in a race to make tools so simple to navigate that they will move from a specialist tool to the mainstream. Is the world finally ready for digital signage to be as easy to operate as other marketing and sales platforms?</p>

                <p>CMS stands for content management system but I've always wondered if a communication management system would suit better for the purpose? Isn't a truly effective digital signage system as responsive and integral as a company's website and social media platforms?</p>

                <p>The big brands like Microsoft, SAP and Salesforce are looking into this space, while the challenger brands and established experts are all moving at speed towards making the complex simple. What are the main barriers to truly scale the business?</p>

                <p>So far during the last 2 years I've met with a number of the big digital signage players and there are a number of different views and approaches being presented. Some brands want to keep focus on the big customers and make a system which intricately serves up communication at scale, while some others want to develop the long tail and better serve SMEs. Some want to keep their complex and tailor made offering, some others want to build the platform to empower integrators (and even end users!) to manage it on a SaaS platform. In my view there is no one right option and the future is a combination of all of these. Easy to say, difficult to achieve.</p>

                <p>The "panacea" of having a long list of partners using your CMS platform and being well trained to be able to offer it to their end users requires a simple enough end user interface to be light touch on an ongoing basis. No-one has achieved this yet.</p>

                <p>Advertising and marketing agencies, all types of corporate companies, restaurants, retailers, etc…all have a list of common platforms to manage everything from their finance systems to email marketing from SAP, MailChimp, Slack, Hubspot and Teams for example. When it comes to managing or launching a campaign, digital signage in physical spaces can be as important as the online campaign for many retailers, QSR businesses and public transport organisations particularly. Is the CMS platform able to be well integrated and managed directly by the marketing team responsible for the campaign? Or is there a step through the IT department or even the CMS service provider to upload and manage the content? Giving marketers and inhouse teams access and tools to manage a digital estate could be the game-changer for the industry.</p>

                <p>Who will win the race? Will it be established or emerging CMS platforms standardising UX and services and scaling, or big players like Teams, Salesforce, SAP and Adobe which already have the customers but not the specialist focus…or a combination of both? Will we see consolidation with big companies acquiring CMS platforms to enter into the segment? That must certainly be on the card?</p>

                <p>Either way this is an exciting moment for integrators as what can be achieved with digital signage comes into focus and companies will be able to write it into their communications strategy in a way which can only be great news for the industry.</p>

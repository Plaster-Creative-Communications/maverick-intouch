                <h2>The Huddly IQ is built for laps, home desks and meeting rooms</h2>
                <p>The last 5 years has seen AV transform almost beyond recognition.</p>

                <p>Interactive flat panels, after something of a shaky start in the 00’s and 10’s outside of education proved themselves as essential tools in workspace collaboration. The immediate impact on meetings was obvious, simply due to the physical presence of IFPs in meeting spaces. However, the next big step will take place under the hood. As hybrid meetings and meeting spaces continue to develop, their habits and user expectations develop alongside, and it is the advancements made by artificial intelligence in devices that we will be taking for granted in, we predict, just two years from now.</p>

                <p>AI is of course not a new term, it has in fact been in use since 1955, the capabilities of machines however has never been deployed on this scale into content cameras, microphones or displays before now.</p>

                
                <p>What are the actual tangible benefits will end users be excited about? On the right we can see what an AI powered Huddly IQ can see in a meeting. Participants are picked out and focused on whilst objects are categorised by their utility to the in-room users. With this, an integrated vision processing unit (vpu), performs auto-zoom and auto-framing for a more natural video conferencing experience. Active speaker tracking keeps conversations focused, while whiteboard awareness enables interactivity for truly productive, naturally collaborative meetings. People counting generates ongoing room usage data for facilities and IT teams.</p>

                <p>In tandem with hardware improvements are the development of analytics platforms, which takes the data from cameras, microphones and IFP’s, ingests the data and provides useful information for what feels like the first time. Logitech Sync, Lenovo ThinkSmart Manager and Microsoft Intune all provide central device management. Each stands out in their own way, which we will discuss in an upcoming article. However they all enable easy device management and collect room usage information. As AI has found itself at a vital alignment of technology and consumer demand it is now set to transform the hybrid working environment from tolerable to truly collaborative and exciting in the very near future.</p>

                <p>When brought altogether this technology brings the dynamism of physical meetings into our hybrid meetings, something we never even thought we needed before the events of 2020. As participants with AI cameras will be free to move and interact with their own space and content knowing that they can clearly be shared and seen by their online team. Homeworkers can present meetings on their feet, free from their home desk hunch, without the financial and time sinkhole of creating a full streaming setup. </p>
                
                <p>Lenovo, Logitech and Huddly are just a handful of the Maverick vendors already embracing and integrating this technology, putting it to use in a way which users don’t notice, but will very shortly begin to.</p>

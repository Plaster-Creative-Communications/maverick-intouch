            <p>Despite most of us being out of the office for 2020, Sony TEOS has had a full year of firmware updates, new services and training platforms, writes Sven Berckmoes of Maverick AV Solutions</p>

            <p>Sony TEOS is one of the most reliable workplace management platforms available. It is built to provide full control over devices, signage and content across entire ecosystems, from meeting rooms to reception areas.</p>
                
            <p>TEOS is the digital foundation which holds corporate communications together. Despite the majority of us being out of the office for 2020, the smart workplace solution has had a full year with firmware updates, new services and training platforms all contributing to effectiveness of the platform.</p>

                <h2>Firmware</h2>
                <p>TEOS 2.2 was first announced at ISE 2020. Then with the onset of the pandemic and now the return to work, space and building management solutions needed to be ready to adapt to hybrid work. Here, TEOS came into its own to help integrators to rapidly deploy building management systems.</p>
 
                <p>TEOS 2.2 has been designed to maximise the utility of new advances in IoT sensor tech. The goal is to increase safety, integration and generate new productivity solutions. Sony has made the platform agnostic, meaning that AV integrators and managers will be able to manually add new devices for remote management from third party suppliers, making for straightforward integration of TEOS with existing solutions.</p>
                    
                <p>There is a huge list of updates but the most interesting is how room status is communicated. Users can check out a site overview with relevant information such as live occupancy. There are now 12 languages available to translate room booking content into meeting room content and organisations can easily <p>display any meeting room information on signage.</p>
                    
                <p>Teams can use Connect, Book and Reception directly from Outlook, driving greater efficiency by enabling one-click mirroring or the ability to invite guests to sign-in.</p>
                    
                <p>Signage placed in meeting rooms or in buildings will automatically update when meetings begin and end, driving greater productivity, eliminating waiting times and reducing energy costs. Communication managers can efficiently push corporate messaging as a screensaver to employees and visitors through any connected signage, including room booking tablets.</p>

                <h2>Hardware</h2>
                <p>Along with the software updates, the TEOS update also came with some new kit. Four new professional tablets have been added to the TEB-XP series, built to display meeting room and signage content in business and education scenarios, with models available in  7”, 10”, 15” and 22” sizes all powered by Android 8. There is also a new 4K Android Player for Connect, enabling signage and meeting room mirroring and two new sensors, one for desks to measure occupancy and a meeting room sensor to measure both occupancy and CO2.</p>

                <h2>ACE Training</h2>
                <p>In order to support the channel in adapting to the new way of working, Sony has launched the Architects, Consultants & Engineers (ACE) Portal. It is built on years of experience and should be every consultant’s first stop when beginning to dive into Sony’s Pro AV solutions.</p>
                <p>Whether you’re an architect, consultant or an AV design engineer, this comprehensive portal was designed to maximise your time and productivity on site, ensuring you acquire the technical feedback necessary to help you lead and provide the best solution for your opportunities. If your needs are for product technical information, resources, Building Information Modelling (BIM) content, case studies, white papers or more, the goal is to provision and position you to win your projects.</p>

                <h2>Learnings</h2>
                <p>Corporate communications are essential in the return to work where lobbies will utilise smart signage and video. 2020 has undoubtedly proved a challenge for digital signage, and radical shift in market needs has forced manufacturers to rethink their hardware and developers to repurpose their software.</p>
                <p>Sony has done both. Bravia professional displays provide simple interactivity for users whilst the infrastructure of TEOS has continued to strive for simple communication through advanced systems.</p>
                <p>Maverick AV Solutions provides the whole Sony ecosystem to integration partners, including BRAVIA professional displays, and can provide expertise and support for whole TEOS service.</p>
